This python code selects the optimal reference point for time series InSAR analysis. It requires input of a shapefile for the Area of Interest (AOI), and input the products from TOPS stack processing from ISCE. 

The code automatically finds the optimal reference point for each of the polygons in the shapefile. It requires MintPy, gdal, and other basic python packages.

This code is associated with a paper "Automated Reference Points Selection for InSAR Time Series Analysis on Segmented Wetlands in California", Zhang et al. (in review).

The script will be incorporated into MintPy in the near future.
